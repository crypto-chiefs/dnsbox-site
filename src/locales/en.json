    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What does DNSBox do?",
    "a1": "DNSBox lets you get a free SSL certificate for any IP address — even if you don’t own a domain. Just use a subdomain like 123.123.123.123.dnsbox.io, and we’ll issue and manage the certificate for you automatically.",

    "q2": "How do I use DNSBox?",
    "a2": "Simply replace your IP in the URL with <code>IP.dnsbox.io</code>. For example:</br>\nhttps://167.172.5.205.dnsbox.io </br>\nWe’ll handle the DNS and SSL setup — you don’t need to configure anything.",

    "q3": "Can I get HTTPS for an IP address without a domain?",
    "a3": "Yes — that’s exactly what DNSBox is built for. You’ll get a valid SSL certificate for your IP address with no need to register or own a domain. Just use a subdomain like <code>IP.dnsbox.io</code> and we’ll complete ACME validation via Let’s Encrypt.",

    "q4": "Is it secure?",
    "a4": "Yes. We use Let’s Encrypt and secure all traffic with HTTPS. You can also manually verify the issued certificate at any time.",

    "q5": "Is it free?",
    "a5": "Yes — it's completely free for public use, and the source code is open.",

    "q6": "Which IPs does DNSBox work with?",
    "a6": "It works with any public IPv4 or IPv6 address.",

    "q7": "What if I have a dynamic IP?",
    "a7": "You can still use DNSBox, but the certificate will only be valid for the IP used during setup. For dynamic IPs, we recommend pairing with a DDNS service.",

    "q8": "How long are the certificates valid?",
    "a8": "Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. DNSBox will automatically renew them for you.",

    "q9": "Can I use DNSBox in production?",
    "a9": "Absolutely. DNSBox is production-ready — perfect for CI/CD pipelines, public APIs, SPAs, IoT deployments, or anything that needs HTTPS over an IP address.",

    "q10": "Do I need to register or create an account?",
    "a10": "No. DNSBox works without registration — no account required.",

    "q11": "What happens if my server is offline?",
    "a11": "If your IP (e.g., *.dnsbox.io) becomes unreachable, browsers will show a connection error. DNSBox will keep the certificate active, and everything will work again once your server is back online.",

    "q12": "How does IP verification work before issuing a certificate?",
    "a12": "We use DNS-based validation via subdomains. DNSBox controls the dnsbox.io zone, which allows it to quickly create the required TXT records for Let’s Encrypt.",

    "q13": "Can I use DNSBox with private/internal IPs (e.g., 192.168.0.1)?",
    "a13": "No. DNSBox only works with publicly accessible IP addresses on the internet.",

    "q14": "Where’s the source code?",
    "a14": "<a href=\"https://github.com/crypto-chiefs/dnsbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View on GitHub</a>"
